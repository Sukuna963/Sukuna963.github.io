***This subject is aimed at students with little to no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident in their ability to write simple programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python 3 programming language.***

### Finger Exercise Lecture 1
Assume three variables are already defined for you: a, b, and c. Create a variable called total that adds a and b then multiplies the result by c. Include a last line in your code to print the value: print(total)

```python
a = 10
b = 5
c = 2

total = (a + b) * c

print(total)

```

### Finger Exercise Lecture 2
Assume you are given a variable named number (has a numerical value). Write a piece of Python code that prints out one of the following strings: 

- positive if the variable number is positive
- negative if the variable number is negative
- zero if the variable number is equal to zero

```python
number = int(input("Enter with number: "))

if number > 0:
    print("number is positive")
elif number < 0:
    print("number is negative")
else:
    print("number is equal to zero")
```

### Finger Exercise Lecture 3
Assume you are given a positive integer variable named N. Write a piece of Python code that prints hello world on separate lines, N times. You can use either a while loop or a for loop.

```python
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
while n > 0:
    print("hello wold!")
    n -= 1
```

### Finger Exercise Lecture 4
Assume you are given a positive integer variable named N. Write a piece of Python code that finds the cube root of N. The code prints the cube root if N is a perfect cube or it prints error if N is not a perfect cube. Hint: use a loop that increments a counter—you decide when the counter should stop.

```python
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
count = 0
cubic = 0
is_cubic = False
while cubic <= n:
    if cubic == n:
        print(f'{n} is a perfect cube')
        is_cubic = True
        break
    count += 1
    cubic = count**3

if not is_cubic:
    print(f'{n} is not perfect cubic')
```

### Finger Exercise Lecture 5
Assume you are given a string variable named my_str. Write a piece of Python code that prints out a new string containing the even indexed characters of my_str. For example, if my_str = "abcdefg" then your code should print out aceg.

```python
my_str = input("Enter a String")
new_str = ""

for position in range(len(my_str)):
    if position % 2 == 0:
        new_str += my_str[position]

print(new_str)
```

### Finger Exercise Lecture 6
Assume you are given an integer 0 \<= N \<= 1000. Write a piece of Python code that uses bisection search to guess N. The code prints two lines: count: with how many guesses it took to find N, and answer: with the value of N. Hints: If the halfway value is exactly in between two integers, choose the smaller one.

```python
N = int(input("Enter a number: "))

low = 0
high = 1000
guess = (low + high)//2
count = 0

while guess != N:
    if guess < N:
        low = guess
    else:
        high = guess
    guess = (low + high)//2
    count += 1

print(f'count: {count}')
print(f'answer: {guess}')
```

### Finger Exercise Lecture 19
In this problem, you will implement two classes according to the specification below: one Container class and one Stack class (a subclass of Container).

Our Container class will initialize an empty list. The two methods we will have are to calculate the size of the list and to add an element. The second method will be inherited by the subclass. We now want to create a subclass so that we can add more functionality—the ability to remove elements from the list. A Stack will add elements to the list in the same way, but will behave differently when removing an element.

A stack is a last-in, first-out data structure. Think of a stack of pancakes. As you make pancakes, you create a stack of them with older pancakes going on the bottom and newer pancakes on the top. As you start eating the pancakes, you pick one off the top so you are removing the newest pancake added to the stack. When implementing your Stack class, you will have to think about which end of your list contains the element that has been in the list the shortest amount of time. This is the element you will want to remove and return.

```python
class Container(object):
    """
    A container object is a list and can store elements of any type
    """
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initializes an empty list
        """
        self.myList = []

    def size(self):
        """
        Returns the length of the container list
        """
        return len(self.myList)

    def add(self, elem):
        """
        Adds the elem to one end of the container list, keeping the end
        you add to consistent. Does not return anything
        """
        self.myList.append(elem)


class Stack(Container):
    """
    A subclass of Container. Has an additional method to remove elements.
    """
    def remove(self):
        """
        The newest element in the container list is removed
        Returns the element removed or None if the queue contains no elements
        """
        if self.size() > 0:
            return self.myList.pop()
        return None
```

### Finger Exercise Lecture 20
In this problem, you will implement two classes according to the specification below: one Container class and one Queue class (a subclass of Container).      

Our Container class will initialize an empty list. The two methods we will have are to calculate the size of the list and to add an element. The second method will be inherited by the subclass. We now want to create a subclass so that we can add more functionality—the ability to remove elements from the list. A Queue will add elements to the list in the same way, but will behave differently when removing an element.

A queue is a first-in, first-out data structure. Think of a store checkout queue. The customer who has been in the line the longest gets the next available cashier. When implementing your Queue class, you will have to think about which end of your list contains the element that has been in the list the longest. This is the element you will want to remove and return.

```python

    A container object is a list and can store elements of any type

    """
    def remove(self):
        """
        The oldest element in the container list is removed
        Returns the element removed or None if the stack contains no elements
        """
        if self.size() > 0:
            return self.myList.pop(0)
